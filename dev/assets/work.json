      {"label": "Architect and Developer of the distributed Mapping Platform", "details": "The 'Mapsquare' project codename was released under the brand **Jawg** (Jawg maps). I was the first developer of the platform.  \r\nMy main role was to create a distributed ecosystem of micro services for our Mapping Platform. Storage API (GIS allowing to manipulate and manage datasets), Tile-edge (a highly efficient Map Server), Static Maps API, authentication system, and the administration section."},
      {"label": "Management of Clustering / Data Import SDK / Geo-Caching", "details": "In order to be highly efficient, GIS need to implement specific features such as multi-threaded Geocaching, Meta-Tile awareness, Server-side clustering, and multi-layer clustering.  \r\nAlso, managing datasets often requires to import heterogeneous Data from different providers. I was in charge to create the API for a Data Import SDK targeting on-premises versions of the platform for some of our customers. This allowed to handle tricky cases such as transaction rollback, data deduplication (both semantical and geographical), and conflict resolution."}
