**Why do you wake up in the morning?
What gives you energy in your everyday life?**

My name is **Loïc**.
I am a reader, a music junkie, a travel addict, and a fulltime geek.

Although my CV relates more about Java Reactive programming, indoor/outdoor Maps, DevOps, HA & scaling, and other cool stuff, I also enjoy contributing on java, Node.js & Web OpenSource projects, hacking IoT devices, and sharing my passion through conferences about technology.

I spend my energy and time in different ways. As the CEO & CTO of Jawg Maps, the new disruptive mapping platform in Europe, as a teacher in different universities, and in tech-related non-profit organizations such as HAND, Resourcepool, or Hermitage.

On the side, I am a board member of H.A.N.D. (Hackers Against Natural Disasters), a non-profit organization which involves hackers to fight natural disasters with technology, save lives and raise awareness. The latest operation (codename Caribe Wave 2017) was about creating POC hacks, tools and devices in response to the UNESCO Earthquake & Tsunami scenario played in the Caribbeans. It took place in Guadeloupe and was covered by many local medias and French newspapers. See the retrospective here (french).

I spend (waaaaayyy) too much time in my local Fablab, love making my own drones and use 3D printers, CNCs and laser-cut devices for fun or sometimes real stuff ^^.
Last but not least, I enjoy contributing on java / IoT / training OSS projects, hacking IoT devices, and giving conferences about technology. In 2014, we launched an organization called Resourcepool (https://resourcepool.io) to help create Training content for universities, students, and entry-level devs.

Most of my current OpenSource contributions are detailed in the Projects page.

Interested in what we do? Shoot me an email and let's discuss it.

Some time ago, I realized (like many others before me) that beyond self-growth, opening to others can change your perception. Giving your whole self into helping others brings inspiration, fulfillment, and more passion and respect for what we as humans can achieve in this world.
I feel grateful for sharing thoughts and passion in Universities and Companies around things that matter for me:
Happiness at Work, and Technology: Java, Android, DevOps, Performance Tuning, the history & future of the web, etc…

So far, I was involved with Epitech, INSA Lyon, École 42 (Xavier Niel), CPE Lyon, INSA Rouen, Mines de Nantes, Mines de Douai, Université Paris 7, ECE Paris, ISART Paris, EPF Sceaux, Université de Technologie de Troyes, Université de Rouen, CESI Nancy, ENSI Caen, ESAIP Angers, Faculté d'Orsay, ENSTA ParisTech, Université de Technologie de Compiègne.

Jawg is fully funded by eBusiness Information. Meet us at the next StateOfTheMap Conference in Japan in August 2017!

I wish you an amazing day.

Loïc
