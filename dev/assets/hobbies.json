Not something you would actually get rid of easily.\n<br/>Since 2009, I have been traveling to more than 30 different states or countries, having a chance to experience and share with many different\nand amazing cultures. <br/>Since I started working, I set myself one goal: Travel <b>each month</b> to a foreign country. So far, this has been going great!"
